# Persist-it

A Sinatra based application for keeping your notes organized and safe.

## About

I am one of those people who actually loves taking notes. Unfortunately, I don't keep my notes very well organized. I have some study notes taken in notepad in one folder. I have a few more in a Goole Docs file. I have other notes that are imprtant to me, about my kid's milestones, in a random Word Doc. I wanted a place where I could keep all my notes organized (grouped by topic) and safe (additionally backed up on a website). So, I built it. Welcome to my app, Persist-it!

## Installation
